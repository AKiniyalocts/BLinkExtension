<P>BLink for Behang is a way for you to integrate your wallpapers into Behang. You make a very small, easily coded application that Behang reads and parses your JSON from. This kills the hassle of you having to manage your own full-blown application.</p>
<p>Things Behang currently offers you...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cloud based wallpapers, that are updated outside of the android application</li>
    <li>Support for android 2.1 and up</li>
    <li>Download/Apply Full Resolution images</li>
    <li>Favorite support</p>
    <li>Completely original works</li>
    <li>Muzei support</li>
</ul>
