<h1>BLink for Behang</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>BLink is a very fast and easy way for you to get your wallpapers published on the Google Play Store!</p><br>
<p>To get started, create a new Android Application Project using your prefered IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Android Studio, etc.)</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>When creating, there is no need for a "Default Activity". Many IDE's create this by default (because you usually want that when starting a new Android project). So, if you are given the option to, do not create a default activity.</p></li>
</ul>
